# Udemy_Course_Sales_&_Revenue_Analysis

## Project Introduction

Udemy is a leading global online learning platform that empowers individuals, companies, and governments with the skills they need to achieve their goals. With over 57 million learners, more than 213,000 courses, and over 74,000 instructors, Udemy plays a significant role in modern, accessible education.

Like most data-driven organizations, Udemy is continuously seeking opportunities to improve its business model and increase revenue while ensuring learners receive high-value content.

Over the next four weeks, your manager will be preparing a strategic report for the CEO. This report must include clear recommendations on how to increase quarterly earnings based on current sales data and course performance.

## Our Mission

Our goal is to analyze Udemy's course data to:
- Understand key trends and customer behavior
- Discover which course attributes drive sales and revenue
- Identify high-performing course categories and opportunities for growth

By the end of this project, we will be able to deliver actionable insights to support better decision-making and revenue growth for Udemy.

## Tools used

This project will be carried out in two phases:
1. Excel Analysis â€” Perform exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and key insights using Excel.
2. Python Analysis â€” Conduct deeper analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
